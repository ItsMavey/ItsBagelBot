"""
Spotify API Wrapper

This module provides a simple wrapper for interacting with the Spotify API.
It includes all authentication and request handling functionalities towards the Spotify platform.

It also includes methods for playback, queue management, and searching tracks
with a custom ranking algorithm for fuzzy matching.
